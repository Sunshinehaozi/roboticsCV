## Deep RL Arm Manipulation
This project is based on the Nvidia open source project "jetson-reinforcement" developed by Dustin Franklin. The goal of the project is to create a DQN agent and define reward functions to teach a robotic arm to carry out two primary objectives:

- Have any part of the robot arm touch the object of interest, with at least a 90% accuracy.
- Have only the gripper base of the robot arm touch the object, with at least a 80% accuracy.

## Implementation
Follow instruction in [README](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-DeepRL-Project/blob/master/README.md) of Deep RL Arm Manipulation to accomplish the project. I have provided a reference implementation in this [file](http://https://github.com/ViolinLee/roboticsCV/tree/master/projects/deep_reinforcement_learning_arm/project_master/c).
