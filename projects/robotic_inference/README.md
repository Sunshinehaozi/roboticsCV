The implementations of deep convolutional neural network for image classification application in NVIDIAâ€™s digits are
described. Two datasets are used, and both have three categories. The first dataset include photos taken from a Jetson mounted over
a conveyorbelt for the purpose of real-time sorting. The second dataset is pictures of aircraft. CNN architecture used here include
AlexNet and GoogLeNet are discussed and implemented.
